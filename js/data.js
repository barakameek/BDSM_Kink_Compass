    "aftercare": { term: "Aftercare", definition: "The process of emotional and physical support provided after a BDSM scene or intense experience. Can include cuddling, talking, hydration, snacks, reassurance, etc. Essential for well-being and to help manage 'drop'." },
    "bdsm": { term: "BDSM", definition: "An umbrella term for a variety of erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage & discipline, dominance & submission, sadism & masochism. It encompasses a wide range of activities and relationship dynamics based on consensual power exchange and sensation play." },
    "dom": { term: "Dominant (Dom/Domme)", definition: "A person who takes a controlling, authoritative, or leading role in a BDSM dynamic or scene. 'Domme' is often used for a female-identifying Dominant." },
    "sub": { term: "submissive (sub)", definition: "A person who consensually relinquishes some form of control or power to a Dominant partner in a BDSM dynamic or scene. Often derives pleasure or fulfillment from this yielding." },
    "switch": { term: "Switch", definition: "A person who enjoys taking on both Dominant and submissive roles, either at different times, with different partners, or even within the same scene." },
    "top": { term: "Top", definition: "Often used to describe the person who is 'doing to' or administering an activity (e.g., impact, bondage). Can overlap with Dominant but is more about the active physical role in a specific act, not necessarily overall power dynamic." },
    "bottom": { term: "Bottom", definition: "Often used to describe the person who is 'being done to' or receiving an activity. Can overlap with submissive but is more about the receptive physical role." },
    "ssc": { term: "SSC (Safe, Sane, Consensual)", definition: "A widely known ethical framework in BDSM emphasizing that activities should be conducted safely (risks understood and mitigated), with all participants of sound mind and able to consent, and with explicit, ongoing consent from everyone involved." },
    "rack": { term: "RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)", definition: "An alternative ethical framework to SSC, acknowledging that not all kink is inherently 'safe' or 'sane' by conventional standards. It emphasizes awareness of risks, informed consent to those risks, and personal responsibility." },
    "prick": { term: "PRICK (Personal Responsibility, Informed Consent, Kink)", definition: "Another ethical framework, similar to RACK, emphasizing individual accountability, thorough understanding of activities, and knowledgeable consent in kink practices." },
    "limit": { term: "Limit (Soft/Hard)", definition: "A boundary regarding activities or behaviors. A <strong>Soft Limit</strong> is something one might be hesitant about, willing to try under specific conditions, or wants to approach cautiously.

    "safeword": { term: "Safeword", definition: "A pre-agreed word or signal used during a scene to communicate distress or a desire to stop or modify the activity. Essential for maintaining consent and safety." },
    "subspace": { term: "Subspace", definition: "An altered state of consciousness some submissives may experience during intense scenes, often described as euphoric, floaty, detached, or intensely focused. Can be a result of endorphin release, adrenaline, or psychological immersion." },
    "domdrop": { term: "Domdrop", definition: "An emotional or physical crash that a Dominant partner may experience after an intense scene, often due to adrenaline withdrawal, responsibility fatigue, or post-scene reflection. Aftercare is important for Doms too." },
    "vanilla": { term: "Vanilla", definition: "A term used to describe conventional sex or relationships, without BDSM or kink elements. Can also refer to a person who is not involved in or interested in kink." },
    "scene": { term: "Scene", definition: "A pre-negotiated period of BDSM activity or roleplay, often with a defined start, end, specific activities, roles, and goals. Can range from short and simple to long and complex." },
    "kink": { term: "Kink", definition: "A broad term for unconventional sexual desires, fantasies, or practices. Often overlaps with BDSM but can also include fetishes or activities not strictly tied to power exchange." },
    "fetish": { term: "Fetish", definition: "A strong sexual interest or arousal focused on a non-genital body part, a non-living object, or a specific situation. When it causes significant distress or impairment, it might be clinically diagnosable, but as a kink, it's a specific focus of arousal." },
