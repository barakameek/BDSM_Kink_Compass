      title: "üëÇ Active Listening Practice",
      desc: "During one conversation today, focus *only* on understanding the other person. Ask clarifying questions. Resist the urge to interrupt or plan your response while they speak.",

      desc: "Practice expressing a feeling using an 'I feel...' statement instead of blaming or accusing. E.g., 'I feel unheard when...' instead of 'You never listen...'",

    {
      title: "üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Patience Practice (Dom)",
      desc: "Find one moment where you feel impatient with your partner's progress or response. Consciously pause, take 3 deep breaths, and offer encouragement instead of pressure.",
